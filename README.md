# âš¡ ZAP Electronics - E-Commerce project

## ðŸŸ¢ About

The main intention behind this beautiful full-stack project was to learn and explore new skills. It allowed me to dive into both front-end development, using React, and back-end development with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. I had complete control over the entire development process, allowing me to customize and optimize every aspect of the project to meet my specific needs and goals.

Please be aware that this project does not support actual transactions, and its design is not responsive, as it was not part of the initial Minimum Viable Product (MVP). This project is primarily a learning platform for me to grow and develop my expertise.
